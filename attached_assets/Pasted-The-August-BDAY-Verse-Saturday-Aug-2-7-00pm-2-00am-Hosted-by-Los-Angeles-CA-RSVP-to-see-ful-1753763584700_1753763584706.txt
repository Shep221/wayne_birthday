🚨CALLING ALL FRIENDS, FREAKS, AND FUNKY-TOWN RESIDENTS🚨We’re throwing a BDAY BLOWOUT for your favorite August babes:
👑 Nara Lee (08/01)
👑 Isabella Rovira (08/03)
👑 Wayne Wu (08/11)
🫣 (+ possibly a few mystery Leos ready to reveal themselves under the disco moon)

🗓️ AUG 2 | 🕓 7PM – 2AM
7 hours of joy, chaos, and possibly a séance with your inner child.

📍Venue: The whole Songbird Café in LA Chinatown is ours for the night. Prepare for moody lights, haunted vibes, neon energy, and deep main character behavior.

🅿️ Parking:
There’s street parking around the block, and paid parking ($8–$15) available under the building.
PLEASE don't drink and drive — we chose this spot in Chinatown to be central for everyone, so carpool, rideshare, float, or summon your broomstick.

🖤✨Vibes: Moody lights. Campy chaos. Haunted hotness.
🎨 Dress Code: Black⚫, white⚪, or green🟢. Think ghostly chic meets glam goblin. No pastels. No apologies. Stripes encouraged.

🕺💃Expect:
— Spooky-cute photo ops 📸
— Games to test your friendships 🎲
— Unhinged karaoke 🎤
— Playlists curated by feral DJs 🔊
— Leo-grade birthday drama 🧃

🌮 What’s Included for $45:
— Unlimited Tacos from 7:30PM to 9:30PM
— Light snacks throughout the night
— Secret Shots (if you find the right person) 👀
— Plus the privilege of partying inside a weird little dream with us

🍹 Drinks: Available at the bar for purchase. We do have a minimum tab that we need to hit, so we recommend getting some drinks there (avg. $16-$18/cocktail). If you really wanna get smashed after that, we'll hook you up 😉

🎟️ Who’s in: First-degree besties + a plus-one you’re willing to vouch for. Friends of friends are also welcome.

⚠️ This is not just a party.
It’s a late-summer fever dream.
A vibes-only wormhole.
A celebration of Leos, life, and letting loose.

🖤✨Come dressed to impress, dance like no one's watching, and make memories you'll forget by brunch.✨🖤
Let’s get glam-spooky and unreasonably fabulous.
